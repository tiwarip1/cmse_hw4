This is a repository for collaborating on HW 4

March - 4

Pranjal:
Created the skeleton files including the entities.py file with pseudo code in it to say what it will do
Created the move functions for spartans and wolverines and a small amount of code for them

March - 12:

Pranjal:
Created main_board.py and the class board which contains function __init__, step, run_model, print_model
Modified Entities.py by creating the functions __init__, step, wolverine_reproduce, food_function, wolverine_killed, old_age, name, food_contents in the Wolverine Class
Modified Entities.py by creating the functions __init__, step, spartan_killed, food_function, add_food_from_kill, spartan_reproduce, kill_wolverine, old_age, name in the Spartan Class
Created random_walk.py by creating the function __init__, random_move in the RandomWalker Class
Removed the move_spartan.py and move_wolverine.py files

At this point, the board is created, the spartans and wolverines can move in them randomly, spartans can kill wolverines in the same square as them, both can give birth and die of old age

Cameron- March 17
