    "In this assignment, you'll be exploring how you can use the Python package \"Mesa\" to run agent-based models. Remember, one of the focuses of this class is learning how to use pre-existing software packages to solve problems. In this assignment you'll need to install Mesa, read the documention, and work through the Mesa tutorial individually. After that, you'll work with a group to use Mesa to run your own agent-based model.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary motivations for this assignment, beyond thinking about agent-based models, is to get you more practice with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Mesa is built upon a framework of classes and functions and you'll be finding ways to inherit the functionality of those classes to build your models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You are encouraged to read through the entire assignment before you start to make sure you understand what you're expected to do.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals for this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Mesa to run and visualize an agent-based model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**This assignment is due roughly three weeks from now at 11:59pm on Sunday, March 18th.** Each member of the group should upload a copy of this notebook with the Mesa tutorial completed and notes on the brainstorming session you had with your group. It should be uploaded into the \"Homework Assignments\" dropbox folder for Homework #4.  For the group part of the assignment, you'll create a **private** GitHub repository for your group and add your professor and your TA as collaborators on that repository. Further submission instructions can be found at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your group will be assigned by your instructor.**\n",

    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "* Part 1: Installing and running Mesa (5 points)\n",
    "* Part 2: Brainstorming plans for your agent-based model (5 points)\n",
    "* Part 3: Running your Mesa model for Spartans versus Wolverines (15 points)\n",

    "## Part 1: Installing and running Mesa\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part of the assignment, you'll need to refer to the documentation for Mesa, which you can find [here](http://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Once you have things installed, if you want to explore some of the Mesa example problems, you can get some from their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/tree/master/examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Install Mesa\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the documentation to figure out how you should install Mesa. Check that you've installed it correctly by running the following import command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`from mesa import Agent, Model`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Work through the Mesa tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure you understand Mesa's functionality, you now need to work through the awesome, detailed Mesa tutorial. You can find the tutorial [here](http://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html). This tutorial has you code up a simple model for looking at how wealth distributes itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are expected to work through the material by taking the example code and running it inside this notebook to make sure you can get it all to work. For the next part of the assignment, you'll be working in a group to create a repository of shared scripts that run your agent-based model, so pay attention to the comments in the tutorial about how you would run Mesa using scripts -- you'll have to do that eventually!"

Here's an example of a [wolf-sheep agent-based model](http://netlogoweb.org/launch#http://netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Biology/Wolf%20Sheep%20Predation.nlogo) made using NetLogo (which is a coding language specifically built for running agent-based models).\n",

    "1. How will the Spartans and Wolverines move about in your 2D world? Think about what directions you'll allow them to move in.\n",

    "1. What happens when Spartans and Wolverines interact? Does the Spartan _always_ kill the Wolverine?\n",

Both spartans and wolverines should have a set death rate as a random percentage, but wolverines are subject to death by spartan, while the reverse is not true</li>\n",

If necessary, review the nature of [Predator-Prey models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations), [population dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_dynamics), and [agent-based modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model).\n",
    "\n",
    "For your model, the **predators will be Spartans** and the **prey will be Wolverines**. You should be able to use the documentation for Mesa to guide yourselve through setting up the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since building such a model completely from scratch can be complicated and time consuming you're going to start off by using the pre-made Wolf-Sheep model provided in the Mesa \"examples\" folder on GitHub. You should be able to clone the whole Mesa repository, which you can find [here](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa), but the part that you really need is the \"Wolf-Sheep Predation Model\", which is located [here](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/tree/master/examples/wolf_sheep).\n",
    "\n",
    "The very first thing that should you do is run the Wolf-Sheep model to make sure that it works. Then, **as a group**, you will work to modify the model. You should figure out how to divide up the work so that each person in the group can help to contribute to a shared GitHub repository. **Each person in the group is responsible for making commits to your shared repository**. The very first thing you might want to do is to create the repository and make sure everyone has access to it so that you can start adding files and making changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some ideas for modifications you can make to the wolf-sheep model to make it unique to your Spartans-Wolverines model, but don't limit yourself to just these:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modify the visualization so that the images that are displayed are appropriate for your model (i.e. it shouldn't still display wolves and sheep).\n",
    "* Update the objects/variables to be appropriate for your model\n",
    "* Add new rules and interactions to the model (e.g. what happens with a Spartan runs into a Spartan or a Wolverine runs into a Wolverine?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since meeting with your group in person can sometimes be difficult to coordinate, you should consider dividing up the work so that everyone can work on the code separately and push and pull changes to your repository. A good way to handle this is to assign specific tasks to each person, such tasks might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement a new rule for the agent-based model\n",
    "* Update the variables names to correspond to your new model\n",
    "* Improve the visualization of your model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your completed model must do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Include at least one new element that does not already exist in the wolf-sheep model. This could be a new agent, a new rule, modifications to existing rules or some combination of all of this.\n",
    "2. Modify the visualization so that it is different than the default and makes sense for your model.\n",
    "3. Run successfully so that the instructor can see how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In addition, your project must meet the following code requirements (read these carefully!):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your code must be documented!\n",
    "    - You should include adequate comments and docstrings when appropriate.\n",
    "    - You should choose reasonable variables that make it easy to understand your code.\n",
    "2. Your code should be written as a set of scripts, **it should not just run inside a jupyter notebook** (but you can provide a notebook with examples for presentation purposes, if you wish)\n",
    "    - You should include a README.md file that explains how one should go about running your code and what modifications you made to the default model.\n",
    "3. Your code should be contained in a **private** Git repository hosted on GitHub and your instructors (professor and TA) should be added as collaborators on your repository so that they can clone and run your code.\n",
    "    - Each member of the group **must make at least one commit** to the code repository.\n",
    "    - Your README file should contain information about who contributed what to the completed code.\n"
