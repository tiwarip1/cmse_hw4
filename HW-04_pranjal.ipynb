    "In this assignment, you'll be exploring how you can use the Python package \"Mesa\" to run agent-based models. Remember, one of the focuses of this class is learning how to use pre-existing software packages to solve problems. In this assignment you'll need to install Mesa, read the documention, and work through the Mesa tutorial individually. After that, you'll work with a group to use Mesa to run your own agent-based model.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary motivations for this assignment, beyond thinking about agent-based models, is to get you more practice with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Mesa is built upon a framework of classes and functions and you'll be finding ways to inherit the functionality of those classes to build your models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You are encouraged to read through the entire assignment before you start to make sure you understand what you're expected to do.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals for this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Mesa to run and visualize an agent-based model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**This assignment is due roughly three weeks from now at 11:59pm on Sunday, March 18th.** Each member of the group should upload a copy of this notebook with the Mesa tutorial completed and notes on the brainstorming session you had with your group. It should be uploaded into the \"Homework Assignments\" dropbox folder for Homework #4.  For the group part of the assignment, you'll create a **private** GitHub repository for your group and add your professor and your TA as collaborators on that repository. Further submission instructions can be found at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your group will be assigned by your instructor.**\n",

    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "* Part 1: Installing and running Mesa (5 points)\n",
    "* Part 2: Brainstorming plans for your agent-based model (5 points)\n",
    "* Part 3: Running your Mesa model for Spartans versus Wolverines (15 points)\n",

    "## Part 1: Installing and running Mesa\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part of the assignment, you'll need to refer to the documentation for Mesa, which you can find [here](http://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Once you have things installed, if you want to explore some of the Mesa example problems, you can get some from their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/tree/master/examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Install Mesa\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the documentation to figure out how you should install Mesa. Check that you've installed it correctly by running the following import command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`from mesa import Agent, Model`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Work through the Mesa tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure you understand Mesa's functionality, you now need to work through the awesome, detailed Mesa tutorial. You can find the tutorial [here](http://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html). This tutorial has you code up a simple model for looking at how wealth distributes itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are expected to work through the material by taking the example code and running it inside this notebook to make sure you can get it all to work. For the next part of the assignment, you'll be working in a group to create a repository of shared scripts that run your agent-based model, so pay attention to the comments in the tutorial about how you would run Mesa using scripts -- you'll have to do that eventually!"

Here's an example of a [wolf-sheep agent-based model](http://netlogoweb.org/launch#http://netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Biology/Wolf%20Sheep%20Predation.nlogo) made using NetLogo (which is a coding language specifically built for running agent-based models).\n",

Mesa is designed to build and run agent-based models, but you have to set up the properties of your model and define how agents move and interact within your model. If necessary, review the nature of [Predator-Prey models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations), [population dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_dynamics), and [agent-based modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model).\n",

    "Since building such a model completely from scratch can be complicated and time consuming you're going to start off by using the pre-made Wolf-Sheep model provided in the Mesa \"examples\" folder on GitHub. You should be able to clone the whole Mesa repository, which you can find [here](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa), but the part that you really need is the \"Wolf-Sheep Predation Model\", which is located [here](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/tree/master/examples/wolf_sheep).\n",
    "\n",
    "The very first thing that should you do is run the Wolf-Sheep model to make sure that it works. Then, **as a group**, you will work to modify the model. You should figure out how to divide up the work so that each person in the group can help to contribute to a shared GitHub repository. **Each person in the group is responsible for making commits to your shared repository**. The very first thing you might want to do is to create the repository and make sure everyone has access to it so that you can start adding files and making changes.\n",

    "2. Your code should be written as a set of scripts, **it should not just run inside a jupyter notebook** (but you can provide a notebook with examples for presentation purposes, if you wish)\n",
    "    - You should include a README.md file that explains how one should go about running your code and what modifications you made to the default model.\n",
