I started thinking about how to setup this model and my suggestions are pranjal's jupyter notebook, Also Mesa already has the wolf-sheep
model as one of their examples, so I will be making some scripts that are heavily based on them with some additions.

I have made some scripts that should have the templates for how the classes should run and some of how they interact

I have made most of the scripts necessary and all you need to do is run the main_board file to get a colormap of the stuff on the board
It is pretty well documented, so you should just be able to understand what's going on from reading them, if it doesn't make sense look
at the Wolf-Sheep example from mesa, they are similar, but not exactly the same
